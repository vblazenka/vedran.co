## History
My journey in web industry started in 2014 with front-end internship at [Bellabeat](https://www.bellabeat.com/), first Croatian startup that was accepted to [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) where I decided to pursue Front-End engineering as a career.

To be fair my journey started much sooner, in 2008 when I was in middleschool. I found about game programming and Python and that is where I decided to be a programmer one day.

## Present
These days when I'm not coding I like to organize meetups and workshops to help new developers navigate this vast space of development.

I love to learn about design, psychology, businesses, self-improvement, languages, history and pretty much anything you can throw at me.
